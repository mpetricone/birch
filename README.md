An Atttempt at a x86 kernel in C, from some time ago

### Note
I think i may have used a couple lines from the linux kernel in inc/x86_am/x86msr.h

### Status
It's been a while since I ran it.  It should be OK until the APIC configuration, which was having an issue.


I was using information mainly from the following site, and the Intel x86 documentation.
