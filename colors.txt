The upper 8-bits of each 16-bit text element is called an 'attribute byte', and the lower 8-bits is called the 'character byte'. As you can see from the above table, mapping out the parts of each 16-bit text element, the attribute byte gets broken up further into 2 different 4-bit chunks: 1 representing background color and 1 representing foreground color. Now, because of the fact that only 4-bits define each color, there can only be a maximum of 16 different colors to choose from (Using the equation (num bits ^ 2) - 4^2 = 16). Below is a table of the default 16-color palette.
